Summary of PCB information

**PCBName**: Name of PCB.
**FovStepCnt**: Optimize Fov Step Count. Total steps of FOV.
**PatternedJob**: 
- There are PCBs where identical products are repeatedly placed, such as semiconductors.  
- This PCB uses fewer types of components and many inspection points.  
- So, there is a lot of repetitive information, so we changed the job structure to optimize the data.
**PCBWidth**: Width of PCB in mm format
**PCBLenth**: Length of PCB in mm format
**SplitCol**: Number of Arrays in PCB Column
**SplitRow**: Number of Arrays in PCB Row
**Etc2**: Scale Factor X
**Etc3**: Scale Factor Y
**FidMAX**:  Fiducial Max Count
