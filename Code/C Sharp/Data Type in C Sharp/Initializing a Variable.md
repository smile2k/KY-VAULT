There are two ways to initialize a variable. 
You can initialize it at the <big>**point of declaration**</big> or initialize it in a <big>**separate statement**.</big>
- point of declaration
```CSharp
	 byte userAge = 20;
```

- separate statement
```CSharp
byte year; //declare the variable 
year = 20; //initialize it
```
