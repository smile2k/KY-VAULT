## 1. Directive
They tell the compiler that our program uses a certain namespace.

For instance, the first line 
``` CSharp
using System;
``` 
tells the compiler that our program uses the System namespace.

## 2.Namespace
A namespace is simply a grouping of related code elements. These elements include classes, interfaces, enums and structs etc (weâ€™ll cover each of these elements in subsequent chapters).

For instance, the code below defines two namespaces, both of which contain a class named MyClass. This is allowed in C# as the two classes belong to different namespaces (First and Second).
```CSharp
namespace First 
{ 
	class MyClass { } 
} 
namespace Second 
{ 
	class MyClass { } 
}
```

## 3. The Main() Method
The Main() method is the entry point of all C# console applications. Whenever a console application is started, the Main() method is the first method to be called.
